- create a debug console
- move stuff into other files with script tags
- make sure all assets are loaded before using them
- figure out why scrolling breaks clicking
    - scrolling seems to shift the click region down, which suggests that the mouse position needs to be updated more frequently or is totally broken if scrolling is enabled
- make it so that scenes use a name or a var instead of an id when mouse clicks are switched
- throttle menu video framerate to 30 or 25 fps
- move scene_001 to the new menu rendering mode, after writing menu render function and plugging it in to the render mode system
- make the mouseclick callback call a custom mouseclick handler based on the current render mode, like the keypress callback
- move all render modes into their own objects to create a kind of namespace. then move them into their own files
- object properties seems to be mutable sometimes and immutable other times. figure out why it appears this way (they are always mutable. couldnt reproduce problem)
- find a plugin for vscode that doesnt throw error for comment highlighting AND adds semi-colons to the end of objects for crying out loud
- not sure if repeat, read and apply the airbnb style guide
